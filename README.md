# nopcommerce-prep-journal
A journal to document my internship preperations while going from zero knowledge of creating and maintaining webshops to hopefully master the subject

# Foreword
After quite some effort I managed to land an internship at a company that specializes in creating and maintaining webshops. 
I have no prior experience with this subject, however I do have experience with programming at a somewhat basic level after some courses on udemy and youtube.
As a preperation for the interview at the company I spent a couple of days learning Blazor and relearning html, css and bootstrap by starting on a small sized web project.
As Blazor will be something I will be using at a later date in the company and NopCommerce is the current framework they use, my plan is to spend the following six weeks learning everything I can about NopCommerce before going back and finishing my Blazor project.

# Information about the journal
First of all, I asked chatGPT 4.1 model to write a six week plan for me to learn NopCommerce where I should spend around 60 hours a week.
So during the following six weeks I aim to spend around 360 hours learning NopCommerce and webshops in general.
I will be documenting my progress in this journal at hopefully a daily basis and also do a weekly summary every week.
Right now it's wednesday around 7 pm so I'm roughly three days short of the full six week period, so I will have to catch up a bit somehow, who needs sleep anyways?
