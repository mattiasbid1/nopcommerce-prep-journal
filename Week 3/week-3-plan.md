    Learn seeding and testing with in-memory DB.

Day 5: NopCommerce Data Models [10h]

    Locate where products, orders, users, categories are stored in NopCommerce.

    Explore Nop.Data, look at mappings.

    Add a new property to Product (e.g. “Country of Origin”) and update the admin UI to manage it.

Day 6: Dependency Injection and Services [8h]

    Understand NopCommerce’s DI system, service registration.

    Try creating a custom service and injecting it into a controller or plugin.

Day 7: Scheduled Tasks, Caching, Logging [8h]

    Explore scheduled tasks (background jobs).

    Test changing caching settings, logging errors, and reading the log.

Mini-Project (End of Week 3):

    Extend your earlier plugin or theme to display/use your custom Product property.

    Write a blog post or dev journal entry explaining how NopCommerce’s data flows.
