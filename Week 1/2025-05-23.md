okay so we start off the day with an error

![error1](images/error1.png)

So the connection timed out when trying to access the database, my guess is that my ip has changed since yesterday so azure wont let me in.

Yep, updated the firewall to allow me in, back in business again.

I signed into the store and entered the administration page.

Lets start with the Configuration tab, General settings with basic toggle activated only shows a theme picker, upload a logo, some social media links and a favicon. I'll go ahead and switch to the advanced toggle.

Okay some dull stuff like cookie warning, open/close store, adding a subject field to the contact us page or use system email and then a popup window for terms of service.

Let me create a cheat sheet for the settings, I'll put it in ./Resources/Admintools.md

I went through some settings and added to the cheat sheet, tomorrow I will expand it and try to cover all settings.
