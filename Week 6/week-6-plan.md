WEEK 6: Portfolio Project & Review (60h)
Goals:

    Build a showcase-quality plugin or extension with documentation.

    Polish your GitHub/readme/LinkedIn.

    Prepare demo and review.

Day 1: Plan Your Project [4h]

    Brainstorm features that will impress your internship:

        Advanced product badge system (admin interface for custom badges)

        Bulk edit tool for catalog (mass price update)

        Custom analytics dashboard (graphs for sales, users, products)

        Admin tools: export orders, generate reports, custom notifications

    Write up a short spec (“what it does, who uses it, why it matters”).

Day 2–5: Build the Project [32h]

    Set up plugin skeleton, design UI, build logic.

    Use advanced features:

        Dependency injection, services, scheduled tasks, custom Razor views, AJAX calls, validation, etc.

    Test on fresh database and fresh NopCommerce install.

Day 6: Documentation, Screenshots, Video Demo [8h]

    README.md with:

        What it is, install instructions, screenshots, feature list, known issues, sample config.

    Record a short (2–5 min) screen capture of your plugin in action.

    Add sample test data (JSON/CSV) to your repo.

Day 7: Polish & Review [6h]

    Review your entire dev journal: summarize what you learned, top 10 takeaways, and 5 challenges you overcame.

    Mock interview: answer questions about your project, NopCommerce, plugins, and .NET.

    Polish your LinkedIn profile and GitHub repo.

Deliverable (End of Week 6):

    A fully working plugin/theme/extension, on GitHub with documentation and a video demo.

    A one-pager listing everything you learned, issues solved, and why you’d be valuable as a developer for their company.
