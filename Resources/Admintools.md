You can customize the top menu items of home page, new products, search, my account, blog, forums and contact us and on the footer items you can display sitemap, contact us, search, news, blog, forums, recently viewed products, compare products list, new producs, my account, orders, addresses, shopping card, wishlist and apply for vendor account.

In the sitemap area you can enable the sitemap, change page size, include categories, include manufacturers, include products, tags, topics, blog posts and news items.

Some SEO options also (search engine optimization), option to toggle HTML minification (removes bloat such as comments and whitespace so page loads faster).

In security theres options to add specific IP addresses who can access the backend along with an encryption key and a honeypot.

Whats a honeypot I wonder.

Hm, so it adds invisible fields that normal users wont see but automated bots and similar will fill out and thus trigger antispam, clever thing.

Some options for the robots.txt file, which is a file that adds directives for bots what pages they may or may not access. Though it's a double edged sword considering the parts you assign as sensitive will be more interesting for evil bots to check out.

Ugh, you can enable CAPTCHA, thats horrible, but could be needed sometimes I guess.

Pdf settings, can add a logo for the order invoice, manage the footer text left and right column, change size between A4 and letter, can block access to print pdf invoices for pending orders.

"Sets the CLDR pattern for localization of client-side validation according to the current culture"

No idea about this one, lets find out what it is.

CLDR => Common Locale Data Repository
- a standard to like set number formats, dates etc based on the users language preferences. So 15.5 turns into 15,5 if swedish is active.

The bottom part you can add some custom HTML for the header and the footer and switch between HTML and a rich editor for message templates.
